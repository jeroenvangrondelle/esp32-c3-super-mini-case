## OpenSCAD

Created using OpenSCAD, using BOSL2 and hex-grid libraries. Variable size cases can be generated using SCAD source.

```
    // Regular case, default dimensions for C3 Super Minin board
    case(18, 23.2, 8.5);

    // Same case, but with pass through for wires
    cable_case(18, 23.2, 8.5);

    // A closed lid
    lid(18, 23.2);
```
